		<p>My name is James, and I am aspiring web developer. I come from Long Branch, New Jersey and I have
		graduated from Monmouth University. One of the things that I would like to take away from this course is some knowledge on how to create a mobile app that is a game. I want this game to be popular and enjoyable for everyone!</p>
	
		<p>Some of my hobbies include running, listening to live music, and playing (or trying to play) music.</p>
